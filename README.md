# Getting React Set up (Recommended Method)
1.Prerequisites
```
Node >= 8.10
npm >= 5.6
```
## Step by Step instructions:
```
- Download and install Node.js from here:(https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
   - This will enable the usage of node, npm and npx in the terminal/cmd/powershell.
- Run *npx create-react-app my-first-app*
- Run *cd my-first-app*
- Run *npm start*
- React should automatically launch the template app, in case it does not, go to https://localhost:3000/ on your browser to see the template React app.
```
**To deploy to heroku we need to add buildpack in settings(https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack)**
